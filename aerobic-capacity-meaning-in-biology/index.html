<p>Aerobic capacity is commonly described by the o 2 max, or maximal oxygen uptake. Thus, it is also called a citric acid cycle. Oxygen is present when this form of respiration takes place.

<p>It is determined by a combination of aging and cardiovascular conditioning and is associated with the efficiency of oxygen extraction from the tissue. Sustained effort, without the need to increase the intensity of the exercise. This measurement is an indication of (1) the ability of the cardiovascular system to provide oxygen to working muscles and (2) the ability of those muscles to extract oxygen for energy generation in the form of adenosine triphosphate (atp).

<p>The anaerobic bacteria definition does not require oxygen for its survival. This review focuses on laboratory measures which attempt to quantify anaerobic capacity; Aerobic capacity is defined by the american college of sports medicine (acsm) as the ability to perform dynamic exercise that involves large muscle groups at a moderate to high intensity for prolonged periods.vÌ‡o 2max is the most widely accepted measure of such aerobic capacity.

<p>The strong contemporary functional association of aerobic metabolism with both physical capacity and health is presumably a product of the integral role of oxygen in our evolutionary history. Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy. A corollary of this hypothesis is that aerobic metabolism underwrites complex biological function mechanistically at all levels of organization. More detailed differences between the two are as follows: Aerobic Capacity Definition Examples and Forms.</p>

The vital capacity can be measured with the use of a spirometer, which can also separate the different components of the vital capacity.as seen in the following spirograph, the vital capacity consists of the expiratory reserve volume, the tidal volume, and the inspiratory reserve volume.the expiratory and inspiratory reserve volumes are the volumes of air taken in.
