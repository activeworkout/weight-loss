Our bodies respond immediately to just one exercise session, but we see large adaptations to our bodies when we train consistently over time. During acute exercise the muscles in use require more oxygen for metabolic reactions which creates the energy. The breathing rate and volume of each breath increases to bring more oxygen into the. Your body dips into different metabolic pathways to make these actions happen.
