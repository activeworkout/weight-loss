Mean arterial pressure at rest and during the final minute of each work From researchgate.net
A decrease in mean systemic pressure is reflected in a shift of the vascular function curve to the left. The normal map range is between 70 and 100 mmhg. Here are the steps for this calculation: Map = sbp &#43; 2 (dbp) 3.

<p>Usually it is evaluated by assuming that the left ventricular ejection time (systole) constitutes a constant proportion of the cardiac cycle (i.e. For example, if systolic pressure is 120 mmhg and diastolic pressure is 80 mmhg (as shown in the figure), then the mean arterial pressure is approximately 93 mmhg using this calculation.

<p>Here are the steps for this calculation: For example, if a patient’s blood pressure is 83 mm hg/50 mm hg, his map would be 61 mm hg.
