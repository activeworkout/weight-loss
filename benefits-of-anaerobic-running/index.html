What is Anaerobic Exercise? Benefits, Tips for Practicing, and More From gethealthandbeauty.com
Anaerobic exercise offers a number of health benefits. The basic difference between aerobic and anaerobic is that aerobic requires a constant supply of oxygen, whereas anaerobic can be performed in short bursts without using oxygen. For example, during a walking exercise, you can replenish energy by sprinting for 10 seconds to a minute, or by running quickly and then walking again. Anaerobic running pushes your heart rate above 80 percent of its maximum, which can be stressful on the body.
