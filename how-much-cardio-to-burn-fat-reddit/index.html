Cardio Fat Burning Lose Your Weight Now Q8rashaqa From q8rashaqa.com
A higher intensity may have you only burn 50% of the calories from fat but you&#39;ll be burning much more, say 150 calories in total, which would equal 75 calories from fat. I like weights first, then cardio. Lifting (as heavy as possible) and eating enough protein (your 200g are fine) are your priorities since you want to minimize muscle loss as much as possible. People planning to lose weight should perform cardio for at least 300 minutes a week and those who plan to stay fit should have at least 150 minutes of cardio within a week.
