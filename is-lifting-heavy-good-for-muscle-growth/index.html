So going heavy will help you maximize both strength and muscle gain. The best way to build size and get bigger is by stimulating hypertrophy and muscle growth. There&#39;s more to it than meets the eye, and you need to have a good understanding of everything that goes around it too if you have a chance at maximising your progress.

<p>When it comes to strength training, lighter loads may “grow” your muscles, but it’s the heavier weights that. Volume is the primary driver of hypertrophy, not intensity or load. Size, on the other hand, is about getting a pump and creating microscopic damage to the muscle, which then causes it to repair and grow larger.

<p>Over a period of time, as you grow stronger, it is important to challenge the muscle to lift more for general progress of your strength. Heavy resistance can recruit and engage more of the type ii muscle fibers responsible for generating muscle force. If you choose good exercises, train in the hypertrophy rep range, and you lift hard, 4 sets per muscle may very well be enough, and makes for a good place to start. So going heavy will help you maximize both strength and muscle gain. Pin on Work Out Plans and Food Plans.</p>
