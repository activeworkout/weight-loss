They are often measured to help diagnose different conditions, such as infections, immunodeficiency, autoimmune disease, and certain types of cancer.

Platelets, blood cells that help blood to clot, also get used up, leading to problems with bleeding. There are three classes of cardiolipin antibodies, namely igg, igm and/or iga, which are present in the blood. Schematic drawing depicting the intracellular traffic of cardiolipin.</p>

<p>Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. Persistence is defined as moderate or high levels of igg and/or igm cl antibodies detected in two or more. There are two positive results that may also occur.
