Identification of abnormal cardiopulmonary responses to exercise. A cardiopulmonary exercise test (cpet) is performed to assess current levels of fitness. It can tell the healthcare team how much exercise you can do. We will be monitoring the patient closely during the test, with continuous ecg, blood pressure and oxygen measurements.

<p>Cardiopulmonary stress testing is destined for tremendous growth in the coming years, according to a report from transparency market research (tmr). A cardiopulmonary exercise test falls into the category of a stress test because it involves exercise, which stresses the body’s systems, making them work harder, in order to measure. It has been used in the assessment of elite athletes and for the diagnosis of dyspnoea for which it is now recognised as the gold standard. Cardiac patients have more detailed electrocardiogram.

<p>The cpet laboratory provides a wide variety of evaluations, ranging from resting measurements of metabolic rate to comprehensive exercise studies that rely on direct measurements of heart. The ability to perform physical exercise is critically related to the cardiovascular system’s capacity to supply oxygen (o 2) to the muscles and the pulmonary system’s ability to clear carbon dioxide (co 2) from the blood via the lungs.the cardiovascular and respiratory systems work together to provide both a delivery.
