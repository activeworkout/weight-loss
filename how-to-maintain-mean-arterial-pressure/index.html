Mean arterial blood pressure = cardiac output x total peripheral resistance. It is the difference between the mean arterial pressure (map) and the intracranial pressure (icp), measured in millimeters of mercury (mm hg). Mean arterial pressure (map), the average blood pressure (bp) over a cardiac cycle, is an important measurement of the overall circulating pressure load. Located in carotid sinus, aortic arch, and.

<p>Despite the clinical importance of a personâ€™s arterial pressure, it is well to remember that the single most important requirement for proper operation of the cardiovascular system is to provide adequate perfusion of all tissues. In order to calculate your map, you need to know your diastolic blood pressure (dbp) and systolic blood pressure (sdp) values. For example, if a patientâ€™s blood pressure is 83 mm hg/50 mm hg, his map would be 61 mm hg.
