<p>This fitness term refers to how efficiently your heart (cardio) and lungs (respiratory) work together to supply your body with oxygenated blood over an extended period. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf), the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to working muscles during sustained physical activity, typically expressed as mlo2 kg − 1 min − 1, is often used as a proxy or an objective measure of physical activity [40]. Basically, it’s how well your heart and lungs can work together to pump. To be more specific, cardio endurance is a measurement of the performance of your cardiorespiratory system during sustained physical activity.</p>
