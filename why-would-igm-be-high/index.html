<p>Igm and igg antibodies igm antibody is generally felt to be the first responder to an infection. Immunoglobulin m (igm) is a high molecular weight protein (macroglobulin), consisting of five or rarely of six subunits (igm monomers). This level usually falls off as the igg antibody develops for often long term presence/protection. The procedure is as follows:</p>

<p>Like igg molecules, the igm monomers are composed of two heavy and two light chains, which are linked together by disulfide bridges. Antibodies are proteins that your immune cells make to fight off bacteria, viruses, and other harmful invaders. They are often measured to help diagnose different conditions, such as infections, immunodeficiency, autoimmune disease, and certain types of cancer.
