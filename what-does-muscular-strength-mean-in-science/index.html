Due to various factors, such as genetics, people vary in their response to exercise. Agile strength is more complex and is the kind of strength that you would use when carrying heavy objects in day to day life. Muscular strength is best developed by using heavier weights/resistance (that require maximum or near maximum. This refers to the amount of force the muscles can generate at one time, rather than a measure of how long the muscles.
