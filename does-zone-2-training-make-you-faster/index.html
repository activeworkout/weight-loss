Using the ‘maffetone method’ my aerobic threshold is 147 bpm. The harder efforts or the 20% are important too. You should be able to stay in zone 2 by running at a slow pace, like 5 miles per hour. Also, it’s the most specific type of training you can do for any endurance running event, from a 10k to a marathon.
