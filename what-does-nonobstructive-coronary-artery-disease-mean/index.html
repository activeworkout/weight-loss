Prognostic Significance of Nonobstructive Left Main Coronary Artery From ahajournals.org
Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (minoca) is the term currently used to describe patients presenting with clinical features of an acute myocardial infarct (mi) but without evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease (cad) on coronary angiography, so that the immediate cause for the clinical presentation is not evident. Estimates indicate that at least 50% of the 1,000,000 myocardial infarctions (mis) that occur annually are a first event for persons without known coronary disease. Mild narrowing ranges from 15% to 49% blockage of the artery. Even if it doesn&#39;t progress, mild narrowing is a sign of early blood vessel disease and calls for preventive measures.
