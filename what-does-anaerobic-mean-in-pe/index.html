It is typically used to describe activity in the body that does not require oxygen or exercise of a high intensity over a short time period. Correct muscle imbalances and improve posture. Many types of exercise are aerobic, and by definition are performed at moderate levels of intensity for extended periods of time. Aerobic respiration, as the name suggests, is the process of producing the energy required by cells using oxygen.

<p>The fundamental difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the usage of oxygen in the process of cellular respiration. Many types of exercise are aerobic, and by definition are performed at moderate levels of intensity for extended periods of time. The problem is that there are, in fact, three energy systems: Anaerobic exercise is activity that is done without the use of oxygen. PEC Bulletin Boards for Physical Education.</p>

<p>Correct muscle imbalances and improve posture. Anaerobic exercise may only be sustained for a short period of time, mostly due to the accumulation of lactic acid in the muscles. Aerobic respiration, as the name suggests, is the process of producing the energy required by cells using oxygen. In practical terms, this means that anaerobic exercise is more intense, but shorter in duration than aerobic exercise. Marathon Energy Systems.</p>

Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body without using oxygen; The heavy solids sink to the bottom and anaerobic bacteria, which develop only where there is no oxygen, breed rapidly and break these up so that they rise to the top and provide the ever present scum which excludes all air and stimulates fermentation of the entire content. 😍 Whats the difference between aerobic and anaerobic.
