She suggests still working out five days during the week, with the goal of burning 250 calories per session. An older adult may burn more calories than a young person if the young person has a small body and doesn’t exercise and the older adult is more muscular and exercises regularly. 1900 calories for me (lifestyle = lazy &amp; 4 x lift weight) drops average.5 lb a week, so i experiement with drop in 200 calories for total intake of 1700 &#43; (lifestyle etc.) = 1 lb. The exercise time columns can be sorted from high to low or low to high by clicking on a weight.
