<p>Generally, the faster a personâ€™s heart rate recovers, or reaches its resting rate, the better shape he or she is in. This basically occurs as a result of more demand put on the cardiovascular system to move more blood out of working muscles and return the blood to vital organs, while cleaning out waste products: At five minutes post workout you should be 120 bpm or less. Next, hrr was calculated by the difference in maximum heart rate achieved during exercise and mean heart rate at 10Â±3, 20Â±3, 30Â±3, 40Â±3, and 50Â±3 seconds after exercise.
