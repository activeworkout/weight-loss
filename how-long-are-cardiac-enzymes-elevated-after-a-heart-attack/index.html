Cardiac enzymes have been in use since the mid 20th century in evaluating patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction (mi). Troponin i and t are specific to the heart, and remain elevated for a long time after a heart attack occurs 3. Cardiac troponin levels are normally so low they cannot be detected with most blood tests, so when they are detected, it’s usually significant in showing that heart muscle damage due to a myocardial infarction has occurred.

<p>If doctors suspect you have had a suspected heart attack, a sample of your blood will be taken so it can be tested for these heart proteins (known as cardiac markers). This can happen during and after a heart attack. The most common protein measurement is called cardiac troponin.

<p>According to a research review published in the journal of cardiology &amp; current research in january 2018,. Elevated levels of cardiac enzymes (cardiac biomarkers) in the blood are a sign of heart damage, stress or inflammation. Cardiac biomarkers are proteins from heart muscle cells that have leaked out into the bloodstream after an injury to the cardiac muscle.
