<p>Aerobic respiration produces a considerable amount of energy for use by the organism which gets stored in the atp molecules. Respiration and breathing are two different types of processes that occur. In living cells, a process that uses oxygen to break down complex molecules into simpler ones, releasing energy. Here glucose molecule is completely oxidized into energy (atp), carbon dioxide, and water.</p>

Aerobic respiration occurs in the mitochondria and the cytoplasm of the cell. When a cell needs to release energy, the cytoplasm (a substance between a cell's nucleus and its membrane) and mitochondria (organelles in cytoplasm that help with metabolic processes) initiate chemical exchanges that launch the breakdown of glucose.
