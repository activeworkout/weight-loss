<p>Endurance training is accompanied by a significant fall in resting heart rate (hr) (3,5,9,16,18,19,26).this is certainly due to a reduction in intrinsic heart rate, linked to stabilization of the cell conduction system membrane, as well as a high degree of vagal control of the sinus node. In the endurance sports, the use of hrv has been studied in 2 general settings—the short term and the longer term. What is heart rate training? Heart rate (hr) during different endurance cycling races and events are investigated for professional cyclist, however, enduro races to compete for total laps and distance covered within a fixed time using a circuit course has not yet been investigated.
