<p>The maximum rate is based on your age, as subtracted from 220. For example, if the stroke volume is 75 ml and the heart rate is 100 beats per minute, then the cardiac output is 75 x 100 = 7500 ml/min. For most healthy adult women and men, resting heart rates range from 60 to 100 beats per minute.

This characteristic relationship between cardiac output and heart rate is critically important in the postsurgical care of patients with congenital heart disease with excessively slow or fast heart rates. Taking a pulse not only measures the heart rate, but also can indicate the following: As you age, changes in the rate and regularity of your pulse can change and may signify a heart condition or other condition that needs to be addressed.

<p>As you age, changes in the rate and regularity of your pulse can change and may signify a heart condition or other condition that needs to be addressed. For example, if the stroke volume is 75 ml and the heart rate is 100 beats per minute, then the cardiac output is 75 x 100 = 7500 ml/min. Generally, a lower heart rate at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness.
