<p>Anaerobic “without oxygen” exercise means oxygen demand is greater than oxygen supply and you can’t keep up with the energy your body is demanding. Aerobic refers to cardiorespiratory fitness, and anaerobic refers to muscular fitness. As we can see, the main differences between aerobic and anaerobic exercises are duration, intensity, and above all, energy spent. Aerobic exercise is characterized by increased oxygen consumption while performing.</p>
