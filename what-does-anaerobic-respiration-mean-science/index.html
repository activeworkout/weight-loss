<p>It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Anaerobic respiration is a kind of cellular respiration that happens when oxygen is not available. Anaerobic respiration is less efficient than aerobic respiration, but it can still provide cells with the energy they need to. This series of biochemical reactions is also called a “metabolic pathway.” two types of cellular respiration exist:</p>

<p>The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements. Aerobic respiration is a set of metabolic reactions that take place in the presence of oxygen occurring in a cell to convert chemical energy into atps. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy.

<p>Anaerobic respiration occurs in human muscles and in red blood cells where there are no mitochondria. It should not be confused with fermentation, since it the latter does not involve the electron transport chain. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. The anaerobic respiration uses other types of chemical elements or even more complex organic structures, through an electron transport chain.

<p>Aerobic, or respiration in the presence of oxygen, and anaerobic, or respiration without oxygen. Oxygen is absent when this form of respiration takes place. Glucose + electron acceptors (other than o2) → lactic acid / ethanol + 2 atp molecules. When oxygen is absent in the environment yeast starts to respire anaeribically.

<p>Anaerobic respiration occurs in human muscles and in red blood cells where there are no mitochondria. This series of biochemical reactions is also called a “metabolic pathway.” two types of cellular respiration exist: Glycolysis, in which glucose is converted to two molecules of pyruvic acid (pyruvate) in the general cell cytoplasm. During rigorous exercise, the anaerobic respiration response leads to the production of lactic acid within muscle cells, which facilitates the production of atp, helping to provide additional energy.

<p>Anaerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration where the high energy electron acceptor is neither oxygen nor pyruvate derivatives. Pyruvic acid is produced as a result of incomplete glycolysis in this case. The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements. This series of biochemical reactions is also called a “metabolic pathway.” two types of cellular respiration exist: Schematic (unbalanced) diagram of the anaerobic fermentation pathways.</p>

<p>However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both. This occurs in microorganisms, but is also a temporary response to oxygen. This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals.
