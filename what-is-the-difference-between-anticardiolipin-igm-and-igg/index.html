Antiphospholipid syndrome From slideshare.net
Igg has the highest opsonization and neutralization activities; An anticardiolipin antibodies test looks for a certain type of antibody in your blood. Antiphospholipid syndrome (aps) is an autoimmune disease and is a risk factor for a number of clinical manifestations; The igm antibody recognizes a large variety of pathogenic antigens and plays an important role in body immunity.

<p>An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight off infection. The antibody igm is found to be in lymph and blood, while igg is found to be in body fluids. In 1999, an international consensus conference found that one criterion for the serologic diagnosis of “definite antiphospholipid syndrome” is the presence of anticardiolipin antibody of igg and/or igm isotype, at medium or high titer, on two or more occasions, at least six weeks apart.

<p>These antibodies can still appear during the early localized state of lyme disease, rising a few weeks following the onset of the infection. The two most commonly tested are igg and igm. Igm is produced by the body in response to a foreign invader, such as a virus or bacteria, while igg is produced by the body in response to a different type of antigen. The key difference between cmv igg and igm is that cmv igg is a type of cmv antibody that indicates a person was infected with cmv at some time during their life, while cmv igm is a type of cmv antibody that indicates a primary infection in combination with the presence of igg.

<p>Igm (immunoglobulin g) and igg (immunoglobulin gg) are two types of antibodies. The main difference between igg igm iga ige and igd is their structure and function. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. The key difference between cmv igg and igm is that cmv igg is a type of cmv antibody that indicates a person was infected with cmv at some time during their life, while cmv igm is a type of cmv antibody that indicates a primary infection in combination with the presence of igg.
