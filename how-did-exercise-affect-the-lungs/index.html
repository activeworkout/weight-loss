<p>Lung function is not normally a limiting factor in exercise tolerance. The heart pumps the oxygen to the muscles that are doing the exercise. We suggest that aerobic exercise training decreases the lung inflammatory process induced by dep exposure, but chronic damage caused by deps is too extensive for even exercise to prevent a loss of lung function or the induction of cardiovascular events.
