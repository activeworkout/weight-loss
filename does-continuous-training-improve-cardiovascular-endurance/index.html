Simple endurance training we increase the capabilities of the body From fitandnice.net
Each session record your starting speed and how far along ladder you were able to complete. For interval training, make sure you’ve warmed up 15 to 20 minutes at a low intensity aerobic pace. Cardiovascular endurance exercises lead to increased aerobic power and improved physical performance. Continuous training requires your body to use oxygen to produce energy which means it will improve your respiratory system (your lungs and breathing) and also your cardiovascular system (your heart).
