High blood sugar Symptoms, causes, and healthy levels From medicalnewstoday.com
Moderate to intense exercise may cause your blood sugar to drop during exercise and for the next 24 hours following exercise. The effect of exercise on insulin sensitivity can last for up to 48 hours after the activity. Physical activity stimulates the body to take up more glucose for energy which can cause low blood sugar, especially if carbohydrates aren’t taken in regular amounts while exercising for long periods. Understanding how to maintain healthy blood glucose levels during exercise is particularly important for people with diabetes.
