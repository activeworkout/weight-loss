Anticardiolipin antibodies, cardiolipin antibodies, acl antibody: During the course of the disease, there were periods when the la activity decreased. Anticardiolipin (acl) antibodies measured above 20 cu are considered positive and are associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (aps) as described by international consensus and harris et al [1, 2]. The classic presentations include fetal death or thrombosis (arterial or venous thromboembolism), in the presence of persistently increased titers of antiphospholipid (apl) antibodi.

<p>Cardiolipin antibody tests help diagnose the cause of blood clots, recurrent miscarriages or antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). The quantitative measurement of anticardiolipin (acl) antibody is important in diagnosing antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). A cardiolipin antibody test detects cardiolipin antibodies in the blood.

<p>The iga ( immunoglobulin a) test detects the presence of the cardiolipin antibodies in the blood. Cardiolipin antibody tests help diagnose the cause of blood clots, recurrent miscarriages or antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). A negative anticardiolipin igg or igm result indicates that this type of antibody was not present or was present in too small a quantity in the blood sample being tested. In 1999, an international consensus conference found that one criterion for the serologic diagnosis of “definite antiphospholipid syndrome” is the presence of anticardiolipin antibody of igg and/or igm isotype, at medium or high titer, on two or more occasions, at least six weeks apart.
