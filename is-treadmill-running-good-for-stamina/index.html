How to increase stamina for running on a treadmill? Exercise Bikes Review From exercisebikesreview.com
Your incline can stay at 0% or you can increase it to 1% for the entire set. Aerobic exercise encourages blood flow, or in other words, gets your heart pumping! For every increase in speed, you’ll have 10 more seconds of recovery time, but the time you’re running your fast speed will always be 60 seconds. Use the treadmill to help you run faster by speeding up the pace for short intervals and then slow it down for recovery intervals.
