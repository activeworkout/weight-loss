Aerobic Capacity lesson 1 From slideshare.net
The individualâ€™s aerobic capacity defines the size of the engine in a human being, much as in an automobile. Aerobic capacity is an index of the adaptive ability of large striated muscles to work by using energy from aerobic metabolism. It is the forgotten training threshold, overshadowed by its big brother, the anaerobic threshold. Aerobic capacity is the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use at one time.

While there are a number of ways to measure aerobic capacity (more on this below), think of aerobic capacity as the volume of oxygen pumped through your body in a given amount of time. Heart rate between 140 and 160 beats per minute. Aerobic capacity is commonly described by the o 2 max, or maximal oxygen uptake.</p>
