<p>Heart rate recovery is important because it can be used to understand how the heart recovers after stress. Backgroundalthough a delayed decrease in heart rate during the first minute after graded exercise has been identified as a powerful predictor of overall mortality in cardiac patients, the potential to influence this risk factor by aerobic training remains to be proven. However, they do state that it is impossible to maintain a maximum heart rate for several minutes. Research shows heart rate recovery after exercise may be a marker of poor heart and metabolic health.</p>

<p>Heart rate recovery (hrr) is defined as the difference between peak hr during exercise and exactly 1 min or 2 min into the recovery period after exercise. For example, studies show people who have a slow heart rate recovery are at greater risk of heart attacks and cardiac. While there is a positive relationship between heart rate (hr) recovery rate and cardiorespiratory.
