<p>Vo2max (in l of oxygen per minute) can be measured by having a subject perform an exercise on a treadmill or bicycle in increasing intensity. The body's responses to a single bout of exercise are regulated by the principle of homeostasis. As the enormous value of physical fitness continues to show up in study after study regarding human wellness, the importance of exercise has never been more apparent. On the other hand, biomechanics looks at the study of motion in living things. Anatomy A Pressing Concern in Exercise Physiology.</p>
