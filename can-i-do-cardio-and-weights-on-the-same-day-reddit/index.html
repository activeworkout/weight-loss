<p>So, in one pattern you can do both weights and cardio on same days. I’m “skinny fat” and i want to get lean but i also don’t want to sacrifice my cardiovascular health.

<p>Alternating weights and cardio every other day is a great beginner way to make sure that you are getting adequate rest for your muscles after each workout. Combining workouts is fine, and the order of your workout should be a matter of personal preference. Personally, i do both every time i workout. I would definitely do both., hell i do both.

<p>Just don't overdo it, or you'll start breaking down muscle. Consume carbs pre cardio, you will avoid muscle loss, get a better cardio session, and see better results.

<p>Keep in mind, though, that doing a long cardio session before lifting weights may slightly delay your recovery time—a good reason to give yourself a few days off afterward. I suggest hiit to minimize muscle loss and no more than 3 times a week. If your aim is specifically fat loss, it's better to perform cardio after weight training because weight lifting depletes glycogen stores, helping you to get to the fat burning faster than just doing cardio alone. I had a session with a personal trainer and he told me that you can not do cardio and weight training on the same day. 1300 Calorie Keto Meal Plan.</p>
