Aerobic exercise is cardiovascular conditioning that strengthens both your heart and lungs. This is a great intensity for beginners to feel comfortable getting started. The term “aerobic” literally means “with oxygen,” meaning that breathing controls the amount of oxygen delivered to the muscles, assisting in fuel combustion and movement. (anaerobic [without oxygen] exercise, on the other hand, relies primarily on glucose and glycogen [the stored form of glucose], and often involves intense activity performed in repeated short bursts.).
