<p>Cardiac output = heart rate x stroke volume. Cardiac output = stoke volume x heart rate • when anybody exercises, their cardiac output will increase because. How does exercise affect heart rate. A part of the medulla oblongata called the cardiovascular control centre is responsible for changing heart rate according to our body’s needs. BIOLOGY FORM 4 CHAPTER 7 RESPIRATION PART 2.</p>

<p>Again, the stretch receptors in the muscles give a more rapid indication of muscular activity, allowing an anticipatory increase in breathing rate even before the carbon dioxide concentration the blood has. For example, muscles in the arteries in your legs relax to allow more blood flow. Benefits of high output during exercise: The increase in heart rate allows more co2 to be removed from the respiring tissues. BIOLOGY FORM 4 CHAPTER 7 RESPIRATION PART 2.</p>

<p>The american heart association recommends that you do exercise that increases your heart rate to between 50 and 85% of your maximum heart rate. The muscles will increase in size and have a greater density of capillaries, more mitochondria, more glycogen and myoglobin. Before starting it, make sure you have been resting for a few minutes so that your heart is at its resting heart rate. The increased adrenaline levels in the blood increase the heart rate.
