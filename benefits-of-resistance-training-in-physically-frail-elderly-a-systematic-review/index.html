<p>It is suggested that supervised and controlled rt represents an effective intervention in frailty treatment and promoted significant enhancements on muscle strength, muscle power, and functional outcomes. Exercise is one of the most important components in frailty prevention and treatment. In addition, some studies have shown that resistance training designed to improve muscle power output (high speed of movement) enhances several functional outcomes in the healthy elderly.
