<p>As soon as the translation process ends. It also relates to the process of producing proteins from mrna templates. Translation takes place on ribosomes in the cell cytoplasm, where mrna is read and translated into the string of amino acid chains that make up the synthesized protein. When the ribosome moves to the mrna, it reaches the stop codon (uag, uga, uaa).</p>

<p>Translation takes place on ribosomes in the cell cytoplasm, where mrna is read and translated into the string of amino acid chains that make up the synthesized protein. Transcription in biology is the making of rna using the dna as a template. Mrna may be a copy of one or smattering genes from a cell's chromosome. Translation, as related to genomics, is the process through which information encoded in messenger rna (mrna) directs the addition of amino acids during protein synthesis.

Transcription and translation are the two processes that convert a sequence of nucleotides from dna into a sequence of amino acids to build the desired protein. Translation, as related to genomics, is the process through which information encoded in messenger rna (mrna) directs the addition of amino acids during protein synthesis.
