HIIT VS. RUNNING WHICH IS BETTER FOR WEIGHT LOSS? QUESTION ANSWERED From thekitchenofarunner.com

Hiit has been around for years, but has had an upsurge in popularity as people who have less time available but want the same results have been looking for something without the time commitment and hard slog of going out for a long run/bike ride.
