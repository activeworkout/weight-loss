Difference between Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration Bio Differences From biodifferences.net
Anaerobic respiration is respiration without oxygen; A type of cell respiration that takes place in anaerobes, and in which energy is released from glucose and other foods without the presence of oxygen. It isn’t as efficient as aerobic respiration, because oxygen is an extremely attractive element to the electrons that facilitate the production of atp, helping them move through the transport chain during the. Without the process of anaerobic respiration, there would be no energy supplied to muscles in these times of high demand.

<p>Correct muscle imbalances and improve posture. Sometimes the body cannot supply the muscles with the oxygen it needs to create energy, for example during intense exercise. Anaerobic respiration is the metabolic process in which oxygen is absent, and only the stage of glycolysis is completed. The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements.
