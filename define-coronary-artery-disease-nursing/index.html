We treat narrowed or blocked vessels with lifestyle changes, medications, percutaneous coronary intervention, and/or surgery. The coronary arteries branch from the base of the aorta and encircle the heart in the coronary sulcus (atrioventricular groove) at the junction of the atria and ventricles, and these arteries are compressed when the ventricles are contracting and fill when the heart is relaxed.
