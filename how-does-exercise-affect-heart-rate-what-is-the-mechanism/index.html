Exercise stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and will induce an integrated response from the body; When you perform cardiovascular exercises, the entire blood flow becomes directed towards the working muscles, away from the regions that aren’t working much (like your digestive tract or arms).

<p>Exercise stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and will induce an integrated response from the body; Every feedback loop — positive or negative — has the following five steps: Increased respiration, excitement, anoxia, co 2 excess, adrenaline secretion, etc., all come in and increase the heart rate. If that were true, watching a scary movie would do the trick. Cardiac Output Cardiac Output = Stroke Volume x Cardiac Rate.</p>

<p>After exercising your heart rate should increase and your blood pressure should decrease (blood pressure association, 2008). Exercise can help you live a healthy life and have a controlled weight. Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles. Effective exercise occurs when the lungs, heart and muscles work harder together. How does exercise affect heart rate? GCSE Physical Education (Sport.</p>
