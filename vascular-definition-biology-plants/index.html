<p>What is the purpose of the xylem in a vascular plant? Vascular plants have vascular tissues which distribute resources through the plant. The plant vascular system is a complicated network of conducting tissues that interconnects all organs and transports water, minerals, nutrients, organic compounds, and various signaling molecules throughout the plant body. It is composed of two major tissues, xylem and phloem, that are differentiated from the meristemic tissue. The plant vascular system functions as the conduit for longdistance.</p>
