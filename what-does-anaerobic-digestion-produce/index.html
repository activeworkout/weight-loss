Anaerobic digestion is the process of bacteria breaking down organic waste into biogas and other products in the absence of oxygen. Not only do the bacteria remove contaminating compounds from the effluent, thereby reducing discharge costs, they produce green energy at the same time. The biogas then demands further processing for recovery. Anaerobic digestion is a biological process in which organic matter is converted by several independent, consecutive, and parallel reactions.
