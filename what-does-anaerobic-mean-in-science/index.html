State The Balanced Chemical Equation For Cellular Respiration From tessshebaylo.com
The word aerobic, which i think perhaps you mean, means &#39;with air&#39;. Anaerobic respiration is the type of respiration through which cells can break down sugars to generate energy in the absence of oxygen. Of, relating to, or being activity in which the body incurs an oxygen debt. Effects of anaerobic exercise on your health.

<p>Anaerobic exercise is any activity that breaks down glucose for energy without using oxygen. The heavy solids sink to the bottom and anaerobic bacteria, which develop only where there is no oxygen, breed rapidly and break these up so that they rise to the top and provide the ever present scum which excludes all air and stimulates fermentation of the entire content. Anaerobic respiration is the opposite of aerobic, since it involves a type of respiration that does not involve oxygen.
