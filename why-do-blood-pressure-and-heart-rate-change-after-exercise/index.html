<p>This requirement is more than what we need while lying on a bed. Our muscles require a bit of extra oxygen when we do exercises. When you perform cardiovascular exercises, the entire blood flow becomes directed towards the working muscles, away from the regions that arenâ€™t working much (like your digestive tract or arms).
