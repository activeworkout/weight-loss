Do not increase the speed of your curl. In this workout challenge we have modified the workouts to make them maximally effective while keeping to a 30 minute or less time limit. Daniel created this routine using a ladder style interval that starts at 10 seconds per set and ends at 60 seconds per set. The beginning level of this exercise is just a simple side step, letting your trailing leg come behind you with a slight tap, as well as adding the large circular arm swing.
