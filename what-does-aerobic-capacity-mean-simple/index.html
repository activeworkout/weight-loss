<p>It is determined by a combination of aging and cardiovascular conditioning and is associated with the efficiency of oxygen extraction from the tissue. While there are a number of ways to measure aerobic capacity (more on this below), think of aerobic capacity as the volume of oxygen pumped through your body in a given amount of time. The physiology of aerobic and anaerobic fitness the word ”aerobics” is used to describe organisms that consume oxygen and comes from the greek words for “life” and “air”. For runners, it is essential to know the difference between aerobic (when muscles contract by consuming oxygen) and anaerobic (when muscles contract without oxygen consumption).</p>
