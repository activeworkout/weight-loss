An ecg lead is a graphical representation of the heart’s electrical activity which is calculated by analysing data from several ecg electrodes. Crl measured 21 mm corresponding to 8 w 6 d of gestation. To evaluate the significance of cardiac activity on endovaginal ultrasound in embryos up to 10 mm in size. By the time the embryo measures 2 mm the fetal heart rate activity should be seen and normal embryos start at under 85 beats per minute heart rate.
