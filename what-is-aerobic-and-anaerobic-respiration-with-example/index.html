<p>Anaerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration where the high energy electron acceptor is neither oxygen nor pyruvate derivatives. In higher organisms, aerobic processes take place when cells generate energy from the oxidation of organic molecules which is a process that releases large amounts. Cellular respiration is of two types, i.e. Aerobic respiration — takes place in the presence of oxygen. The Role Of Carbohydrate, Fat And Protein As Fuels For Aerobic And.</p>
