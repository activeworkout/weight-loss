<p>You can use the cardio activity and turn on gps for outdoor use. On the garmin device i set my activity level to 7 on garmin connect, and i also enabled the “life time athlete option as my resting heart rate is below 60 (49 actually). The only way i can get garmin to count cardio is to start a separate cardio activity and do whatever else as cardio (yoga, pilates, circuit routine) instead of as its actual activity in garmin. Though garmin includes both activity and workouts in the active calories number in their dashboard, we separate it out so you can see each workout.
