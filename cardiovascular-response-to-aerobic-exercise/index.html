<p>Your blood carries nutrients to your muscle cells to create energy that your muscles need to contract. Whilst ageing reduces cardiovascular performance, regular exercise induces adaptations that attenuate some of these reductions, leading to improvements in blood pressure and aerobic performance. During isometric contraction, blood flow. Focus on augmenting cardiac output.</p>

<p>In order to change cardiac output, there may be a change in either heart rate or stroke volume. Most of the cardiovascular changes that occur during exercise are brought about by changes in autonomic nerve activity, triggered by the cardiovascular centre. For example, it seems that increased mass and dilation of the left ventricle allow maintenance. 50% of a person’s maximum heart rate, or an rpe of 5 throughout) then the heart rate will rise until it reaches what is known as ‘steady state’ where it stays relatively constant as the cardiovascular system meets the demands placed on it by.

<p>During exercise, the job of the cardiovascular system is to deliver blood and oxygen from the heart and lungs to your working muscles. As a result the predominant energy system and fuel source used changes throughout the exercise in order to maintain the required level of performance. Current public health recommendations are for adults to be physically active at a moderate intensity for 150 min or greater per week at a vigorous intensity for 75 min or greater per week or a combination thereof ().these recommendations are based on studies showing that exercise training improves various cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychological measures ().

<p>Aerobic exercise is defined as physical activity that is. When you begin to exercise your body must immediately adjust to the change in activity level. As you can see, cardiac output plays a key role in determining the vo2. Most of the cardiovascular changes that occur during exercise are brought about by changes in autonomic nerve activity, triggered by the cardiovascular centre.

<p>The primary function of the cardiovascular system is to increase oxygen supply to the skeletal and cardiac muscle. Commonly assessed through a graded aerobic exercise test on a treadmill or cycle ergometer. For example, it seems that increased mass and dilation of the left ventricle allow maintenance. The cardiovascular response to exercise consists of a massive increase in cardiac output combined with a massive decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, predominantly of the skeletal muscle vascular beds.

<p>In order to change cardiac output, there may be a change in either heart rate or stroke volume. The cardiovascular response to exercise consists of a massive increase in cardiac output combined with a massive decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, predominantly of the skeletal muscle vascular beds. People are also becoming more aware how beneficial cardiovascular response of the body to aerobics is. Augmentation of cardiac output (co) is the central determinant of maximal oxygen consumption (v o 2), as defined by the fick equation: Cardiovascular Endurance Aerobic Exercise.</p>

<p>As a result the predominant energy system and fuel source used changes throughout the exercise in order to maintain the required level of performance.

Two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain how these responses are actually initiated: Oxygen is needed for many types of exercise. Current public health recommendations are for adults to be physically active at a moderate intensity for 150 min or greater per week at a vigorous intensity for 75 min or greater per week or a combination thereof ().these recommendations are based on studies showing that exercise training improves various cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychological measures ().</p>

One way it does this is by boosting the production of nitric oxide, a gaseous chemical. Commonly assessed through a graded aerobic exercise test on a treadmill or cycle ergometer.
