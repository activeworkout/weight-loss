2 minutes warm up at 40 to 50 percent maximum heart rate. Perform 1 warmup set with body weight or light weight before starting the 3 working sets. If we estimate that your metabolism would use 50 calories per day to sustain that muscle, this means you will burn 250 more calories every day (50 calories/day x 5 pounds). With a pound of fat requiring you to burn 3,500 calories, you will lose 26 pounds in a year without spending an extra minute on cardio.
