Cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions that break down glucose to produce atp, which may be used as energy to power many reactions throughout the body. Thus respiration at the cellular level is burning of food using oxygen to get energy. Aerobic respiration happens in most of the organisms. This happens when you get so much exercise (say on a very long hike or run) so that your body runs low on oxygen for cellular respiration.
