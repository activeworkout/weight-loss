Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of blood fat that is important for blood clotting. They help to regulate the way the blood is able to clot when an injury occurs, though the process of it is not completely. Cardiolipin exposure on the outer mitochondrial membrane modulates α.</p>

<p>Your test results may not mean you have a problem. Cardiolipins are found within the outer layer of cells and platelets. The antibodies are igg (immunoglobulin g), iga (immunoglobulin a), and igm (immunoglobulin m). Moderate to high levels of cardiolipin antibodies persisting when tested 12 weeks later, indicates continued presence of the antibody.
