The filling of the ventricle (diastole) is followed by ventricular contraction (systole) to provide an adequate cardiac output during both rest and exercise to meet the body&#39;s metabolic demands. The importance of cardiac cycle is to sustain human life. Furthermore, each time the heart contracts it does so with all its dynamism.

<p>The contraction of the heart is known as systole and relaxation is termed as diastole. It does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac cycle. This makes your heart work harder, pumping blood through your body more quickly.

<p>The cardiac cycle is defined as a sequence of alternating contraction and relaxation of the atria and ventricles in order to pump blood throughout the body. The period of contraction that the heart undergoes while it pumps blood into circulation is called systole. There are two stages during the cardiac cycle. This process is called the cardiac cycle.
