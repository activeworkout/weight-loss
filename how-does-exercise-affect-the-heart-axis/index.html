<p>The electrical axis of the heart (heart axis). Doctors used to think of arteries as passive conduits for blood, working for your body the way a garden hose works for your lawn. This effect is due to increased activity in your vagus nerve, which acts to slow down the heart at rest.

<p>The qrs complex, which represents ventricular depolarization, is used for the determination of the electrical heart axis. The human body must pump blood throughout itself to provide oxygen and nutrients for the brain and other components for the human body to function properly. If the axis is more positive than 90° it is referred to as right axis deviation. For the first time researchers are beginning to understand exactly how various forms of exercise impact the heart.

<p>This effect is due to increased activity in your vagus nerve, which acts to slow down the heart at rest. Exercise also promotes positive physiological changes, such as encouraging the heart's arteries to dilate more readily. This is essential to increase the amount of gas, oxygen and carbon dioxide, during exercise. Since oxygen is transported through the bloodstream, the heart needs to pump more blood to supply the working muscles with oxygen. Respiration key.</p>
