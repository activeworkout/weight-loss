Role of anaerobic and anaerobic metabolism in exercise. From slideshare.net
When the body is resting, the body is quickly trying to get oxygen into the muscles to nourish, repair and clear the waste products in the muscles. Anaerobic means to conduct an activity without oxygen. In fact, anaerobic means absence of oxygen. this can be contrasted with aerobic exercise that consumes oxygen at a sustainable pace such that an activity can be continued for a long duration of time. Anaerobic exercise can also improve endurance and cardiorespiratory efficiency by increasing vo2 max.
