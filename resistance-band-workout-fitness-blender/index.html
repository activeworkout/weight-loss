They’re lightweight and portable, and they cost less than a month’s subscription at a lot of health clubs, yet they can significantly boost stamina training exercises. Is anyone else interested in moving towards more resistance band workouts? Pull the resistance band up so the top reaches above your shoulder, with the band resting on the back of your arm.
