<p>Despite these efforts, physical activity participation around the globe remains low. Examples include arrhythmias , sudden cardiac arrest, and heart attack. The extent of decreased risk of coronary heart disease attributable to regular physical activity is similar to that of other lifestyle factors, such as abstaining from tobacco use. A new study found that being physically active can considerably, but not completely, lower the risk of cardiovascular disease associated with being overweight or obese.</p>
