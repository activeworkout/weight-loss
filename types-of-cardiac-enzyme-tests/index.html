Cardiac enzyme studies measure the levels of enzymes and proteins that are linked with injury of the heart muscle. Determine if blockages are present in the coronary arteries. This test measures the levels of cardiac biomarkers in your blood. They can be useful in the early prediction or diagnosis of disease.
