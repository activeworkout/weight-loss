<p>With good cardiovascular fitness comes better endurance. Cardiovascular exercises are used mainly by sportsmen and sports coaches, to increase their overall endurance.a type of beep test, pacer stands for progressive aerobic cardiovascular endurance run. There are many tests that can be done to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness (the efficiency of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems during exercise). The assessment of the anaerobic threshold is often performed by measuring lactate in the blood and is usually around 4 mmol./l, also known as obla (beginning of lactate accumulation in the blood).
