What is the Difference Between Anaerobic and Aerobic Conditioning From perform-360.com
The aerobic system, as you can. Aerobic exercise is the use of your large muscles in a light to moderate way such that you can meet your oxygen needs for an extended duration of time. This system is dependent on oxygen and while it&#39;s the slowest method for producing atp, it produces the biggest volume and is the system our body relies on for everyday processes. The aerobic system is used by a soccer player to deliver the consistent energy necessary to go about the pitch at a medium degree of activity.

<p>Marthaon runners work at about 80% of thier heart rate because the body cannot burn oxygen quickly enough to produce energy. The aerobic system produces far more atp than either of the other energy systems but it produces the atp much more slowly, therefore it cannot fuel intense exercise that demands the fast production of atp. This can be contrasted with anaerobic exercise such as weight lifting that uses massive amounts of oxygen in a short time such that it can't be sustained for long. This is only one of the three energy systems that work together.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, releasing energy is one of the inevitable processes that occurs in the body during a workout. This can be contrasted with anaerobic exercise such as weight lifting that uses massive amounts of oxygen in a short time such that it can't be sustained for long. However, when the intensity increases and the demands on the body change, the body must use other methods. Energy systems of the body.

The aerobic system is used by a soccer player to deliver the consistent energy necessary to go about the pitch at a medium degree of activity. Short surges of a few seconds are primarily anaerobic, but maximal efforts of 70 seconds see an equal energy contribution from aerobic and anaerobic sources.
