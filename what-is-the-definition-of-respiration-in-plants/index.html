Respiration is a process fundamental to every living organism. If the process faces difficulty, then it. Just like humans, a marijuana plant has to breathe: Anaerobic respiration occurs in organisms like yeast, certain bacteria, and parasitic worms.

<p>Plants respire through root hair. The respiration process in all living beings must be conducted fluently. What is the simple definition of respiration? Plant respiration is the process of plants using up the sugars made through photosynthesis and turning them into energy for growth, reproduction, and other life processes.</p>

<p>The complete oxidation of food with use of oxygen and when the entire carbon is released as carbon dioxide is called aerobic respiration. Respiration is the most vital, cellular, enzymatically controlled, catabolic process, which involves the liberation of energy by the breakdown of food substances inside the living cells. Organisms make use of such energy for their activities by oxidising these high energy food molecules into simple low energy molecules, i.e., carbon dioxide and water. The respiration process in plants occurs using various respiratory substrates, while the most common being. RESPIRATION IN PLANTS EKUL EDUCATION.</p>

<p>The transmission of electrons from molecules is also a result of this respiration process.

<p>The energy keeps the plant alive. Glucose (food) + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water + energy. This process is also called intramolecular respiration. Respiration is the most vital, cellular, enzymatically controlled, catabolic process, which involves the liberation of energy by the breakdown of food substances inside the living cells.
