<p>While cardio training is most often associated with fat loss, it is also the best way to improve aerobic capacity, which is the ability to use oxygen to fuel exercise activity. The aerobic threshold is the uppermost limit of exercise when the production of energy starts to become dominated by anaerobic glycolysis (sugars) rather than the oxidation (aerobic in nature) of fats. It is the forgotten training threshold, overshadowed by its big brother, the anaerobic threshold.

<p>Good aerobic capacity (cardiorespiratory fitness) has been shown to reduce the risk. Vo2max reflects the maximum rate that the respiratory, cardiovascular, and muscular systems can take in, transport, and use oxygen during exercise. See if you can walk up five flights of stairs at your own pace without stopping, using the railing only for balance. Aerobic capacity is evaluated using estimates of vo2max (also known as maximal oxygen uptake). What Is Aerobic Capacity and How Can You Improve It? Openfit.</p>
