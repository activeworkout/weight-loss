<p>It allows it to pump a greater amount of blood with each heartbeat. Regular exercise causes a reduction in rhr. But these changes may take weeks, months, or even years to reach their full effect. When under stress, your heart must pump more blood containing oxygen and nutrients throughout your body, which is why your pulse increases.
