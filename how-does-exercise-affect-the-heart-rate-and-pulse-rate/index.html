How does exercise affect your heart rate? GCSE Science Marked by From markedbyteachers.com
While exercising, the heart rate can be checked with a heart rate monitoring device or by examining your pulse. When you exercise your muscles, they demand three times more oxygen than they do when they are at rest. The american heart association recommends that you do exercise that increases your heart rate to between 50 and 85% of your maximum heart rate. A young, healthy athlete may have a heart rate of 30 to 40 bpm.

Your resting heart rate might be lower if you take certain drugs, such as beta blockers. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit.
