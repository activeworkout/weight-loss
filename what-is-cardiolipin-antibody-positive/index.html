An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight off infection. Low positive results are very common and happen within the general population every day. These are autoantibodies directed against components of the cellular membrane. If someone tests positive for cardiolipin antibodies on an initial test, a second test may be performed later to confirm that the antibodies are persistent [].in addition, healthy individuals can test positive for cardiolipin antibodies [].
