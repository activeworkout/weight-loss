Scientists found that you need to train each muscle group twice a week for maximum results. Weight training for 20 to 30 minutes, 2 to 3 times a week is enough to see results. How many times a week should i workout to gain muscle? I normally workout 2 hours a day, however, when it is leg day i only have time to work out 45 or 50 min.
