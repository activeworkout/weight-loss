Exercise is usually the initial lifestyle therapy recommended to prevent, treat, and control hypertension. Youâ€™ll have to walk faster than you normally walk to elevate your heart and breathing rate. It is safe to be more active, and it will help to keep your blood pressure in the healthy range. Hypertension patients need to cool down, that is, slow the pace of exercise instead of stopping abruptly.
