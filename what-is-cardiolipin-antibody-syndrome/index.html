Apa (Anti Phospholipid Antibodies) From yogavanahill.com
Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. Cardiolipin antibody testing may be ordered when a patient has symptoms suggestive of a thrombotic episode, such as pain and swelling in the extremities, shortness of breath, or headaches. Platelets, blood cells that help blood to clot, also get used up, leading to problems with bleeding.
