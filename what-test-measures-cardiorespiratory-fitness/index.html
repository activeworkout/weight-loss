HIT and Running An indepth conversation with Skyler Tanner about From hituni.com
Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) is associated with mortality and cardiovascular disease, but assessing crf in the population is challenging. Count each pulse you feel for 15 seconds and then multiply that by 4 to get your hr per minute. Currently, the recommended method is a graded exercise test (gxt) on an ergometer such as a treadmill or cycle, which may not always be possible. Cardiorespiratory endurance is determined by the amount of oxygen taken in by the body (vo2 max) and how efficiently it is utilised during vigorous activity.

Cardiorespiratory endurance has been recognized as a key component of physical fitness throughout the history of the field. The following sections review the strength of the evidence for a relationship between health outcomes and the four categories of fitness tests for cardiorespiratory endurance (distance/timed run, shuttle run, treadmill, and cycle ergometer).
