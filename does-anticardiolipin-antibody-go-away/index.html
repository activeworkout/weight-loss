<p>Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. The quantitative measurement of anticardiolipin (acl) antibody is important in diagnosing antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). The 2 most common types of antiphospholipid antibodies are lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies. When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur.
