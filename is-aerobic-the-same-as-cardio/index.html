If you have a different question, please modify it back. Aerobic activity is any type of activity performed for long periods of time at submaximal intensities — meaning, you could perform that activity at that intensity for at least 10 minutes. The terms aerobic and cardio are often used interchangeably but should not be. So, as a general statement, any exercise that makes you breathe faster or heavier and makes your body sweat would be classified as aerobic.
