The cardiac cycle can be shown on an electrocardiogram. The short interval between the end of one cycle and the beginning of the next is called the refractory period. The cardiac cycle is the series of events or pressure changes taking place within one heartbeat. The nervous system is made up of the spinal cord, brain and nerves.
