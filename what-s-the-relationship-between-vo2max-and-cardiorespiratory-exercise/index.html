The purpose of this study was to determine whether the maximal oxygen uptake (vo2max) is attained with the same central and peripheral factors according to the exercise intensity. Time limit (tlim) was the time at which the subject was no longer able to pedal at the given power output. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between vo2max and the aerobic demand of running (vo2submax) in elite distance runners. 34.8±9.4 ml/kg/min) were used for analysis.
