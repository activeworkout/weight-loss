<p>The oxygen that enters the lungs, the sun that makes vitamin d in the skin, and the digestive system are three ways the body obtains the molecules it needs. Homeostasis is balance within the body and each of the body systems contribute to maintaining this balance by contributing interactions with their component systems to regulate the functioning of each body system.

Homeostasis is balance within the body and each of the body systems contribute to maintaining this balance by contributing interactions with their component systems to regulate the functioning of each body system.
