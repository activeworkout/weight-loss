<p>Neuroplasticity explains that not only do our brains keep changing, but we actually have conscious control over how the brain changes as we age and have new experiences. Neuroplasticity, also known as brain or neuronal plasticity, is the concept that refers to the way in which our nervous system changes from its interaction with the environment.not even in the case of monozygotic twins this interaction is identical, which means that each person perceives the world and acts on it in a different way, depending on the. Neuroplasticity is the change in neural pathways and synapses that occurs due to certain factors, like behavior, environment, or neural processes. This article will reveal the ways to do it.

<p>Without this ability, any brain, not just the human brain, would be unable to develop from infancy through to adulthood or recover from brain injury. Brain plasticity (from the greek word ‘plastos’ meaning molded) refers to the extraordinary ability of the brain to modify its own structure and function following changes within the body or in the external environment. As you would imagine, this flexibility plays an incredibly important role in our brain development (or decline) and in shaping our distinct personalities. In this article, we'll explore what neuroplasticity is, how it works, and how you can leverage your brain's plasticity to make positive changes in your life.

During such changes, the brain engages in synaptic pruning, deleting the neural connections that are no longer necessary or useful, and strengthening the necessary ones.
