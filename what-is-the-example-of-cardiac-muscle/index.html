Cardiac muscle, also called myocardium, in vertebrates, one of three major muscle types, found only in the heart. Cardiac muscle tissue, also known as myocardium, is a structurally and functionally unique subtype of muscle tissue located in the heart, that actually has characteristics from both skeletal and muscle tissues.it is capable of strong, continuous, and rhythmic contractions that are automatically generated. Cardiac muscle makes up the heart. Cardiac muscle tissue is an extremely specialized form of muscle tissue that has evolved to pump blood throughout the body.

<p>It also helps in the flow of blood. It is striated and under the control of the autonomic nervous system. There are three types of muscle in the human body, each with its own structure and function. Similar to skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated and organized into sarcomeres, possessing the same banding organization as skeletal muscle ( (figure) ). Why is the muscle cell long?

<p>It is striated and under the control of the autonomic nervous system. Cardiac muscle tissue, also known as myocardium, is a structurally and functionally unique subtype of muscle tissue located in the heart, that actually has characteristics from both skeletal and muscle tissues.it is capable of strong, continuous, and rhythmic contractions that are automatically generated. Cardiac muscle is made from sheets of cardiac muscle cells. Highly coordinated contractions of cardiac muscle pump blood into the vessels of the circulatory system.
