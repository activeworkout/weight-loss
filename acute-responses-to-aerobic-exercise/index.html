There is an increased demand for oxygen and energy fuels like cho, pc and the cardiovascular, respiratory and muscular systems respond to meet these needs. Virtually all tissues in the human body rely on aerobic metabolism for energy production and are therefore critically dependent on continuous supply of oxygen.</p>

<p>While exercising, we have an increase stimulation or excitation of the heart occurring so that we are able to supply blood to the skeletal muscles that are working. Two of the key functions of the cardiovascular system are to: The heart and the vasculature. As exercise increases, as does oxygen consumption atp is the immediete source of fuel for all muscular contractions as a result of exercise, atp stores decrease in the muscle, and stores of adp, the by product of atp increase when exercise intensity increases, there is an increase in the rate of metabolism required to produce atp in the muscles Studying Acute Responses To A Single Bout Of Exercise ExerciseWalls.</p>
