<p>All of the organ systems in the human body must maintain a steady internal environment for the body to function properly. The cardiovascular system helps the body maintain homeostasis by the circulation of blood bringing oxygen and nutrients to the organs and tissue. If the concentration is too high or too low, these cells cannot function. Thus the healthy heart can pump more blood when there is more blood to pump. Body systems and homeostasis.</p>
