<p>Increases muscle strength by making ypur muse work against a weight or force. Resistance training (also called strength training or weight training) is the use of resistance to muscular contraction to build strength, anaerobic endurance and size of skeletal muscles. Resistance training is based on the principle that muscles of the body will work to overcome a resistance force when they are required to do so. Resistance is an opposition which allows current to flow if resistance will higher then current will slow if resistance will smaller than current will flow fast.
