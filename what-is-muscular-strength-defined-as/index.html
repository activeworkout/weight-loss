What Is Muscle Mass? From reference.com
Muscular strength is affected by the following factors. The ability to do “work” in physical terms. Muscular strength is defined as the ability of a muscle group to develop maximal contractile force against a resistance in a single contraction. Muscle strength is defined as the capacity to apply the greatest amount of force in the shortest amount of time.

Muscle power is defined as the product of muscle strength and muscle contractile velocity (work per unit time), and since daily living involves dynamic muscle action, loss of muscle power could have a greater impact on functional muscle limitation than muscle weakness per se [54].
