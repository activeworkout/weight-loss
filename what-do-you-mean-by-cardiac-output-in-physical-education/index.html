From venturebeat.com
In cardiac physiology, cardiac output (co), also known as heart output and often denoted by the symbols , ˙, or ˙, is the volumetric flow rate of the heart&#39;s pumping output: Sufficient cardiac output is necessary to sustain energy and life. Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped out of the let ventricle in a minute. Practice to excel and get familiar with the paper pattern and the type of questions.

<p>Cardiac output is a measure of the rate of blood flow through the heart and its associated blood vessels. Cardiac output is an excellent example to exhibit the efficiency of the human heart. The stroke volume is the volume of blood, in milliliters (ml), pumped out of the heart with each beat, 70 ml/beat. Cardiac output is a function of heart rate and stroke volume. .</p>
