<p>These activities require more oxygen consumption that light activities. If the heart rate monitor shows that you’re working at 70 to 85% of your heart rate then it’s vigorous exercise. We tested intensity and duration of weekly physical activity as predictors of heart rate variability in young adults. Things like jogging or running, strength training, brisk walking, fast swimming, bike riding, high intensity cardio, and skipping rope are considered high intensity exercises because of their energy expenditure.
