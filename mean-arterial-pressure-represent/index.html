<p>Mean arterial pressure is significant because it measures the pressure necessary for adequate perfusion of the organs of the body. As blood is pumped out of the left ventricle into the aorta and distributing arteries, pressure is generated. If the blood pressure would plunge below the level of 60 mmhg, it would affect the functioning of the vital organs.

<p>A blood pressure of 83/50, has a map of 61. Moreover, it has a quality which makes it even more interesting, namely its relative “stability” in the arterial tree. Thus, mean arterial pressure is closer to diastolic pressure than to systolic pressure. In contrast to the auscultatory method where mbp is calculated from the systolic (sbp) and diastolic blood pressure (dbp), oscillometric mbp is measured separately from either sbp or dbp.
