An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight off infection. A negative anticardiolipin igg or igm result indicates that this type of antibody was not present or was present in too small a quantity in the blood sample being tested. An iga phospholipid (cardiolipin) antibody result above 15 apl with negative igg and igm phospholipids (cardiolipin) antibody results is not diagnostic for aps. In addition to reference range changes, the manufacturer has recently replaced the serum calibrators and controls prepared from patients sera used in the anti.

<p>The antibodies attack cardiolipins by mistake. An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight off infection. A negative anticardiolipin igg or igm result indicates that this type of antibody was not present or was present in too small a quantity in the blood sample being tested. Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages.
