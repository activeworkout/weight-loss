<p>Glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water + energy. However, in fermentation or anaerobic respiration there is net gain of only 2 molecules of atp from each glucose molecule, which is comparatively much less than that of aerobic respiration. In the process of aerobic respiration, a single molecule of glucose can yield up to 36 atp molecules. What is meant by aerobic respiration?? Respiration in Organism for Class 7.</p>

<p>Aerobic respiration happens in the presence of oxygen and releases more energy than anaerobic respiration. Glucose is completely oxidized into carbon dioxide and water. This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. So, in the case of aerobic respiration, a larger amount of energy is produced as compared to anaerobic respiration process as complete oxidation takes place.
