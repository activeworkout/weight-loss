How Much CARDIO Should You Do To LOSE WEIGHT &amp; FAT? Adam Evans From adamevans.ca
It’s worth noting that more time doesn’t necessarily mean more weight loss. Cardiovascular exercise is great for weight loss, but that&#39;s not the only benefit you&#39;ll get from doing 30 minutes of cardio five days a week. It’s not possible for everyone to find time for daily cardio workouts. Cut down on 300 calories a day.
