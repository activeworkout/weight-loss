The other group is the anaerobes which are further separated into two classes. Anaerobic exercise, on the other hand, involves exercise that is not oxidative; Aerobic bacteria are present in the water, soil and on the different surfaces. They can survive almost all known environment on earth because of their tiny body size and fast growing ability.

<p>In contrast, an aerobic organism is an organism that requires an oxygenated environment. The broad classification of bacteria as anaerobic, aerobic, or facultative is based on the types of reactions they employ to generate energy for growth and other activities. Aerotolerant anaerobes are the ones that do not need oxygen but survive even when oxygen is present but they cannot use oxygen in their metabolism. Anaerobic bacteria dies in the presence of oxygen, and therefore avoids o2. Bacteria, Aerobic; Aerobic Bacteria.</p>
