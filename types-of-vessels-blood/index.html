<p>This amazing circulatory system includes three types of blood vessels — arteries, veins, and capillaries. The three types of blood vessels that exist in our human body are as follows: Arteries and arterioles have thicker walls than veins and venules because they are closer to the heart and receive blood that is surging at a far greater pressure (figure 2). Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart. Blood vessel types anatomical diagram, medical scheme. Circulatory.</p>

<p>Blood vessels are divided into three types based on their structure and functions namely, arteries, veins, and capillaries. A capillary connects an arteriole (small artery) to a venule (small vein) to form a network of blood vessels in almost all parts of the body. Continuous, fenestrated and sinusoidal, each of which have variably sized gaps between the. Capillaries surround body cells and tissues to deliver and absorb oxygen, nutrients, and other substances.

<p>Humans, along with many other animals, have a closed circulatory system. There are three types of blood vessel: The primary function of large blood vessels (i.e., arteries and veins) is the transport of blood to and from the heart, whereas smaller blood vessels (e.g., capillaries) enable substance exchange between the cells and blood. All blood vessels are specifically structured to perform their function. there Anatomy The Three Kinds Of Blood Vessels are three types of blood.</p>
