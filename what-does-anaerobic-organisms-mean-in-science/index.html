Infections caused by anaerobic bacteria can occur almost anywhere in your body. Anaerobic respiration is the type of respiration through which cells can break down sugars to generate energy in the absence of oxygen. Anaerobes are the primary pathogens of wound infections. Infections like tetanus and gangrene are caused by anaerobic bacteria.

<p>An anaerobic organism or anaerobe is any organism that does not require oxygen for growth. Anaerobic respiration is the type of respiration through which cells can break down sugars to generate energy in the absence of oxygen. That is why some foods are touted as healthy because they are rich in antioxidants. Anaerobic respiration is a relatively fast re action and produces 2 atp, which is far fewer than aerobic respiration. Comparison of transcript abundance and average aerobic and anaerobic.</p>
