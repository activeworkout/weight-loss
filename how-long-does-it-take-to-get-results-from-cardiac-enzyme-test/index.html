<p>The test might also check for an enzyme called creatine kinase (ck). If you have come to the emergency department with chest pain, cardiac enzymes may be drawn two or three times, several hours apart. The test checks for the proteins troponin i (tni) and troponin t (tnt). Doctors usually conduct a general test for emergency room patients with heart attack symptoms to look for the presence of certain proteins in the blood.</p>

According to the national heart, lung, and blood institute (nhlbi), the actual blood draw usually takes less than 3 minutes, and the results can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few weeks to. This test checks for levels of enzymes that are released by the heart muscle when it is injured, such as during a heart attack. .</p>

<p>A doctor can first use a heart enzyme test to determine whether a heart attack has occurred. This is a heart enzyme that can leak into your blood and results from heart injury. Creatine kinase and troponin are the two. Sometimes, a cardiac enzyme test may come back normal if the test is performed too. .</p>
