<p>Engaging in exercise causes the heart’s systolic blood pressure (blood vessel pressure during a heartbeat) to rise for a short time. These include decreased resting heart rate, improved ability to draw in deeper breaths, reduced resting blood pressure, increased calories burned to aid weight loss and reduced risk of heart disease. The rise in blood pressure during static exercise is due to two factors: These two countering effects cause a rise in your blood pressure. What's the Connection?

<p>The index finger was placed on the wrist of the subject, approximately 1 inch below the base of the subject’s hand. These two countering effects cause a rise in your blood pressure. During static exercise, mean arterial pressure rises due to an increase in heart rate and, therefore, cardiac output, with no substantial change in stroke volume or systemic vascular resistance.thus, static exercise can significantly raise blood pressure. This happens because the heart rate is too high for the heart to pump blood effectively. Why Does Blood Pressure Increase When Exercising ExerciseWalls.</p>
